Abstract (summary)

From Wikipedia

An abstract is a brief summary of a research article, thesis, review,
conference proceeding or any in-depth analysis of a particular subject
or discipline, and is often used to help the reader quickly ascertain
the paper's purpose. When used, an abstract always appears at the
beginning of a manuscript, acting as the point-of-entry for any
given scientific paper or patent application. Abstraction and
indexing services are available for a number of academic disciplines,
aimed at compiling a body of literature for that particular subject.

The abstract of a thesis or article is a short summary that explains
the main argument(s), topic(s) or findings. In theses, the abstract
normally appears before the table of contents.

Scientific literature takes widespread advantage of the abstract as
the abbreviated style of choice in order to aptly communicate complex
research. In science, an abstract may act as a stand-alone entity in
lieu of the paper as well. As such, an abstract is used by many
organizations as the basis for selecting research that is proposed
for presentation in the form of a poster, podium/lecture, or workshop
presentation at an academic conference. Most literature database search
engines index abstracts only as opposed to providing the entire text of
the paper. Full-texts of scientific papers must often be purchased
because of copyright and/or publisher fees, and therefore the
abstract is a significant selling point for the reprint or electronic
version of the full-text.

Abstracts are afforded protections under copyright law just as any other
form of written speech is protected. However, publishers of scientific
articles invariably make abstracts publicly available, even when the
article itself is protected by a toll barrier. For example, articles
in the biomedical literature are available publicly from MEDLINE which
is accessible through PubMed. It is a common misconception that the
abstracts in MEDLINE provide sufficient information for medical
practitioners, students, scholars and patients. The abstract can
convey the main results and conclusions of a scientific article but
the full text article must be consulted for details of the methodology,
the full experimental results, and a critical discussion of the
interpretations and conclusions. Consulting the abstract alone is
inadequate for scholarship and may lead to inappropriate medical decisions.

Abstract length varies by discipline and publisher requirements. Typical
length ranges from 100 to 500 words, but very rarely more than a page. An
abstract may or may not have the section title of "abstract" explicitly
listed as an antecedent to content, however, they are typically sectioned
logically as an overview of what appears in the paper (e.g. any one of
the following: Background, Introduction, Objectives, Methods, Results, Conclusions).

In journal articles, research papers, published patent applications and
patents, an abstract is a short summary placed prior to the introduction,
often set apart from the body of the text, sometimes with different line
justification (as a block or pull quote) from the rest of the article.

An abstract allows one to sift through copious amounts of papers for ones
in which the researcher can have more confidence that they will be relevant
to his research. Abstracts help a researcher decide which papers might be
relevant to their research. Once papers are chosen based on the abstract,
they must be read carefully to be evaluated for relevance. It is commonly
surmised that one must not base reference citations on the abstract alone,
but the entire merits of a paper.
